UartSerial Echo Sample
======================

This sample demonstrates the serialEvent callback ability of serial wiring
as well as basic transmit and receive. It is meant to be run with an
Arduino attached to your machine via USB cable.

The Arduino is programmed with the SerialEvent sample sketch which reads
characters in on the serialport until a newline is encountered. Once the
newline is received it transmits the entire string back out over serial.
That transmission triggers the serial_event() callback in the code below.

Take note on line 50 that the path to the serial device is different based
on the platform on which you are compiling.

To build this sample ensure you have the C++ dev tools installed on your
platform and run the following command from the root folder of the repo

g++ samples/uart_echo.cpp src/UartSerial.cpp -I include -pthread -std=c++11 -Wall -g -Werror -o uart_echo
